Automatically read files when they've changed. This does what 'autoread' promises to do but doesn't do. This plugin requires +python or +python3.

This is different from the built-in `'autoread'` option in that it periodically checks if the file on the disk has changed, which is _not_ what `'autoread'` does. `'autoread'` only checks if the file is changed on when certain events occur.

Use :Autoread to start checking, and :AutoreadStop to stop.

See :help :Autoread (or the help file) for more information.
